    <h3><b><u>About Bangladesh</u></b></h3>
    <p class="about">Bangladesh,[a] officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh,[b] is a country in South Asia. <br> It is the eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated <br> with a population of more than <b><u>170</u></b> million in an area of <b><u>148,460</u></b> square kilometres <b><u> (57,320 sq mi)</u></b>. <br> Bangladesh shares land borders with India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. <br> To the south, it has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal. To the north, it is separated from Bhutan and <br> Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. <br> Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's political, financial, and cultural centre. <br> Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port. The official language is Bengali, <br>  with Bangladeshi English also used in government.</p>

    <p class="a">Bangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the Partition <br> of British India in <b><u>1947</u></b> as the eastern enclave of the Dominion of Pakistan, from which it gained independence <br> in <b><u>1971</u></b> after a bloody war.[18] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient Bengal was known as <br>Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after 1204 led to the sultanate <br> and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy Mughal Bengal transformed <br> the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy. The Battle of Plassey in <b><u>1757</u></b> marked <br> the beginning of British rule. The creation of Eastern Bengal and Assam in <b><u>1905</u></b> set a precedent for the emergence <br>of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League was founded in Dhaka in <b><u>1906</u></b>.[19] The Lahore Resolution in <b><u>1940</u></b> <br> was supported by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime Minister of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was <br> established with the announcement of the Radcliffe Line.</p>
 
    <h3><b><u>Geography</u></b></h3>
    <p class="b">Bangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India, and shares <br> a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and China. The country is <br> divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges Delta, the largest river delta in the world. <br>[58] The northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast <br> and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges.</p>
